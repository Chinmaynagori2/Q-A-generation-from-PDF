1.1.2 How SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES OF MATTER?

Activity 1.2 ° Take 2-3 crystals of potassium

permanganate and dissolve them in 100 mL of water.

** The SI unit of volume is cubic metre (m*). The common unit of measuring volume is litre (L) such that 1L = 1 dm’, 1L = 1000 mL, 1 mL = 1 cm*.

- Take out approximately 10 mL of this solution and put it into 90 mL of clear water.

- Take out 10 mL of this solution and put it into another 90 mL of clear water.

- Keep diluting the solution like this 5 to 8 times.

- Is the water still coloured ?

Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of matter. With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible.

This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium permanganate can colour a large volume of water (about 1000 L). So we conclude that there must be millions of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate, which keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller particles.

The same activity can be done using 2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate. The smell can be detected even on repeated dilution.

The particles of matter are very small - they are small beyond our imagination!!! 1.2 Characteristics of Particles of
