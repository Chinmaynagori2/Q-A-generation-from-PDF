1.5.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION

Let us understand this with an activity.

Activity 1.14

- Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and keep it near a window or under a fan.

- Take 5 mL of water in an open china dish and keep it near a window or under a fan.

- Take 5 mL of water in an open china dish and keep it inside a cupboard or on a shelf in your class.

- Record the time or days taken for the evaporation process in the above cases.

- Repeat the above three steps of activity on a rainy day and record your observations.

- What do you infer about the effect of temperature, surface area and wind velocity (speed) on evaporation?

You must have observed that the rate of

evaporation increases withâ€”

- anincrease of surface area: We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation increases. For example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out.

- anincrease of temperature: With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state.

- adecrease in humidity: Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases.

- anincrease in wind speed: It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding.
