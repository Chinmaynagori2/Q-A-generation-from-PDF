1.2.3 PARTICLES OF MATTER ATTRACT EACH OTHER

Activity 1.6

- Play this game in the fieldâ€” make four groups and form human chains as suggested:

- The first group should hold each other from the back and lock arms like Idu-Mishmi dancers (Fig. 1.3).

- The second group should hold hands to form a human chain.

- The third group should form a chain by touching each other with only their finger tips.

- Now, the fourth group of students should run around and try to break the three human chains one by one into as many small groups as possible.

- Which group was the easiest to break? Why?

- If we consider each student as a particle of matter, then in which group the particles held each other with the maximum force?

Activity 1.7

- Take an iron nail, a piece of chalk and a rubber band.

- Try breaking them by hammering, cutting or stretching.

- In which of the above three substances do you think the particles are held together with greater force?

Activity 1.8

- Take some water in a container, try cutting the surface of water with your fingers.

- Were you able to cut the surface of water?

- What could be the reason behind the surface of water remaining together?

The above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8) suggest that particles of matter have force acting between them. This force keeps the particles together. The strength of this force of attraction varies from one kind of matter to another.

uestions 1. Which of the following are matter?

Chair, air, love, smell, hate, almonds, thought, cold, lemon water, smell of perfume.

2. Give reasons for the following observation: The smell of hot sizzling food reaches you several metres away, but to get the smell from cold food you have to go close.

3. A diver is able to cut through water in a swimming pool. Which property of matter does this observation show?

4. What are the characteristics of the particles of matter?
