1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE

Activity 1.10

- Collect the following:

(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a cold drink.

(b) containers of different shapes. Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder from the laboratory.

- What will happen if these liquids are spilt on the floor?

° Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into different containers one by one. Does the volume remain the same?

- Does the shape of the liquid remain the same ?

° When you pour the liquid from one container into another, does it flow easily?

We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid.

Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into liquids. The gases from the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants.

All living creatures need to breathe for survival. The aquatic animals can breathe under water due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is

higher than that of solids. This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state.
