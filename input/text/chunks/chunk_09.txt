1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE

Activity 1.9

° Collect the following articles — a pen, a book, a needle and a piece of wooden stick.

- Sketch the shape of the above articles in your notebook by moving a pencil around them.

- Do all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and a fixed volume?

- What happens if they are hammered, pulled or dropped?

- Are these capable of diffusing into each other?

- Try compressing them by applying force. Are you able to compress them?

All the above are examples of solids. We can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force. Solids may break under force but it is difficult to change their shape, so they are rigid.

Consider the following:

(a) What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on stretching? Is it a solid?

(b) What about sugar and salt? When kept in different jars these take the shape of the jar. Are they solid?

(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we are able to compress it. Why?

All the above are solids as: e A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape when

the force is removed. If excessive force is applied, it breaks.

- The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar.

- A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we press it, the air is expelled out and we are able to compress it.
