1.2.2 PARTICLES OF MATTER ARE CONTINUOUSLY MOVING

- Put an unlit incense stick in a corner of your class. How close do you have to go near it so as to get its smell?

- Now light the incense stick. What

happens? Do you get the smell sitting

Activity

- Take two glasses/beakers filled with water.

- Put a drop of blue or red ink slowly and carefully along the sides of the first beaker and honey in the same way in the second beaker.

« Leave them undisturbed in your house or in a corner of the class.

© What do you observe immediately after adding the ink drop?

- What do you observe immediately after adding a drop of honey?

How many hours or days does it take for the colour of ink to spread evenly throughout the water?

Activity 15

- Drop a crystal of copper sulphate or potassium permanganate into a glass of hot water and another containing cold water. Do not stir the solution. Allow the crystals to settle at the bottom.

- What do you observe just above the solid crystal in the glass?

- What happens as time passes?

- What does this suggest about the particles of solid and liquid?

- Does the rate of mixing change with temperature? Why and how?

From the above three activities (1.3, 1.4 and 1.5), we can conclude the following:

Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises, particles move faster. So, we can say that with increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increases.

In the above three activities we observe that particles of matter intermix on their own with each other. They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. We also observe that on heating, diffusion becomes faster. Why does this happen?
