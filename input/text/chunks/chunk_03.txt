1.1.1 MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES

For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the nature of matter. One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the nature of matter â€” is it continuous or particulate?

The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg).

Activity 1.1

Take a 100 mL beaker.

Observe any change in water level. What do you think has happened to the salt?

Where does it disappear?

Does the level of water change?

In order to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt or sugar, has now spread throughout water. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.

Particles of water magnified millions of times

Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles of salt get into the spaces between particles of water.
